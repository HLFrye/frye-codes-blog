This is the source code for my blog, hosted (well, soon to be hosted) at [frye.codes](https://frye.codes).  If you see an error on one of my blog posts, please feel free to let me know by creating an issue, or even submitting a PR if you're really feeling generous :)  

If for some reason you want to download and host this locally (maybe you want a ready made gatsby hosted blog to play with?), all you need to do after cloning this repo is run `gatsby develop`.

Thank you for reading.
